                    <p>Begin your journey by using the intuitive search bar on our homepage. Type in your desired domain name, and our system will perform a real-time check against the PHP Coin blockchain to verify its availability.</p>
                    <p>The search result will clearly indicate if the domain is available, already taken by another user, or a reserved name. Our pricing is transparent and based on the length of the domain nameâ€”shorter, more premium names have a higher value.</p>

                    <p>Once you've found an available domain, connect your Web3 wallet with a single click. We support a wide range of popular wallets for your convenience. After connecting, click 'Register' to start the process.</p>
                    <p>This action initiates a secure blockchain transaction. Upon your confirmation in the wallet, the domain is minted as a unique NFT (Non-Fungible Token) and sent directly to your address. You are now the verifiable and sole owner of the domain.</p>

                    <p>Ownership is flexible. You can securely transfer your domain to any other PHP Coin wallet address. Please note that this is a permanent, on-chain transaction that cannot be reversed.</p>

                    <p>Your domain is more than just a name; it's a digital asset secured on the blockchain. Management rights are tied exclusively to the wallet that holds the domain NFT, ensuring unparalleled security and resistance to censorship.</p>
                    <p>Experience true digital ownership. Unlike the legacy domain system, there's no central registrar with the power to revoke your name. You can even unregister a domain at any time to recover a percentage of its original registration cost.</p>
